We like to donate some of our free time to charity year round, not just a holiday time. We volunteer at the animal shelter, the nursing home, the Veterans Centers, the homeless shelters and many more. 



We teach our children that there are people in life who don't have what we do and it is always "Nice to be KIND" which is the title of our second book. They have learned a lot from a very early age that helping others is always a positive thing to do and that you can never go wrong by being KIND.
