As a family, we try to stay positive, but from time to time, one of us has a bad day and is sad. We know that we cannot have a great day every day, but we do our best to stay positive and talk about our respective days around the dinner table. 



As we each discuss our day, we learn from one another and we help anyone who has had a bad day. It's important that we discuss the good and bad because it gives all an opportunity to get input from our family. We end our day by telling our family that we will always love them unconditionally.Â
