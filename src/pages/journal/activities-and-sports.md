All of our children participate in activities, from sports to dance to gymnastics to chess and much more. We talk to our children about competition and although it is wonderful to win, losing happens and just hope that we win more than we lose.



When we do lose at anything, we sit down with that child and discuss why he or she lost that competition. We then discuss how he or she can do better next time and to realize that we learn from the experience and get back in the game and give it our all.Â
